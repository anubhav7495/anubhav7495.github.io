Hi! My name is Anubhav Mishra. I am a Full stack JavaScript Developer.

I love Open Source Software and have contributed to Mozilla, ToDoMVC and Babel till
date.

I love learning new things, reading books, photography & playing guitar.

My aim with this blog is to document and write about the new technologies and things
i learn and share my knowledge.

`The best way to learn something new is to try to teach it to someone else.`
