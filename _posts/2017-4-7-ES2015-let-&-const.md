## What is ES2015?
> ES2015, also known as ES6 is the most extensive update to the JavaScript language since 1997.

### Problems with `var`

In ES5, we use `var` to declare variables in JavaScript, but `var` comes with some minor problems like:

* `var` follows functional scope, which means only declaring a function creates a new scope, blocks like `curly braces {}` do not.

```javascript
var x = 10; // global x

function one() {
  var x = 5; // local x
  console.log(x);
}

function two() {
  x = 15; // global x
}

one(); // 5
console.log(x); // 10
two();
console.log(x); // 15
```

* **Hoisting**, which means that any variable declaration done using `var` is moved to the top of the current scope.

```javascript
x = 10; // Does not throw refrenceError
console.log(x); // 10
var x; // Declare x
```

Here `x` can be used before being declared because JavaScript engine hoists it to the top of the current scope.

### let & const

In ES2015, `let` & `const` are introduced to address the problems with usage of `var`.

* `let`, is same as `var` but it follows the more intuitve block scope, which means `curly braces {}` create a new scope for variables declared with `let`.

* `const`, is same as `let` but it is used to declare constants, meaning once declared values of variables declared with `const` cannot be altered.

#### Example of block scoping

```javascript
let x = 10; // global x

if(true) {
  let x = 15; // local x
  console.log(x); // 15
}

console.log(x); // 10
```

#### let in for loops

```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3];

/**
 * With var, for loop prints
 * 3
 * 3
 * 3
 */
for(var i in arr) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(arr[i]);
  },0);
}

/**
 * With let, for loop prints
 * 1
 * 2
 * 3
 * as let creates a new copy of i for each block iteration
 */
for(let i in arr) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(arr[i]);
  },0);
}
```

#### let Gotchas

```javascript
let x = 5;
x = 10; // reassigning is allowed
```
```javascript
/* redecleration within same scope is not allowed */

let x = 'Hello';
let x = 'World'; // TypeError: identifier 'x' has already been declared

if(true) {
  let x = 'World'; // new scope
}
```

#### const examples

```javascript
/* const are read-only */

const MAX_LIMIT = 50;
MAX_LIMIT = 100; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

```javascript
/* const require an initial value */

const MAX_LIMIT; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const decleration
```

**Important:** *`const` are also block scoped just like `let`*

## conclusions

1. Use `const` when you want to declare variable whose values would not and should not change.
2. Use `let` for all other places where you would have used `var`.
3. Avoid `var` until unless the use case requires it.
